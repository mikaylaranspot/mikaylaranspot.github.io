This interactive map will include smooth zoom, easy pan over the state of New Mexico and have our data match the information published by BUSYTOURIST to ensure easy usability. With the skills we have built with creating functions, map pop-ups, adding links into our pop-up we will build an interactive map. The spreadsheet will include data points relevant to what a tourist to New Mexico would need, including time of the year open, distance from the nearest city, and what kinds of recreation can be done there. Leafletâ€™s libraries will be used for the map and making clusters for the data points. The site will also use D3 for creating bar graphs displaying popularity and other metrics. In addition, DC and Crossfilter will be utilized to display interactive filters that allow a user to adjust for what time of year they are planning their visit and what types of activities they are looking for. Bootstrap will be used to add pages for information on each location.
